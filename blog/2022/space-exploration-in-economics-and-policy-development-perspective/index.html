The fact that space is an inseparable part of the human environment becomes a natural and necessary thing to be realized by every human being as a self-conscious creature where we as humans are aware of our position and role amid the universe we live in. Basically understanding and curiosity about space are intrinsic traits that every human being has. This is reflected in the fact that the science of astronomy and observation of celestial bodies are among the earliest sciences developed in human civilization and culture. However, space exploration has developed very rapidly recently, precisely from the 1950s to the mid-1970s.</em></p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yQMOkvukRcgFMT08mihZ3g.jpeg"><figcaption>Image by Donald Giannatti from <a href="https://unsplash.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure> <p>tarting from the intense technological competition between the United States and the Soviet Union during the cold war era, space became one of the targets contested by the two major countries as a symbol of their strength and culture. In particular, people know this competition for space exploration technology as the first space race where the United States and the Soviet Union compete to be the fastest to send space satellites to set their astronauts (or cosmonauts for the Soviet Union) to the moon. Of course, as a technology competition, this competition produces so many new technologies and knowledge about space that has never been imagined before, such as measuring the distance of the earth-moon with high accuracy to satellite-based telecommunications systems. This opens the world’s eyes to that space exploration is not merely driven by curiosity and the desire to compete to become the most powerful country, but is an effort to develop a culture that is fast and has a big impact on the foundations of human life, both in applicative terms (technology applications) ) as well as anthropologically (related to the understanding of human position cosmologically). One example of this statement is that humans are so attached to internet technology that is built on the communication technology mentioned earlier. This space exploration race between the United States and the Soviet Union led to the Apollo-Soyuz collaboration mission in 1975 which was considered a “space handshake” by the world community as well as ended the space race between the two.</p> <p>Space exploration which was originally a competition has turned into an international collaboration that can be considered one of the greatest collaborations that mankind has ever undertaken. From this competition, various space agencies emerged, spearheaded by the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Soviet Union’s Soviet Space Program, followed by regional agencies such as the European Space Agency (ESA). The various agencies collaborate on various aspects from knowledge exchange to technology trading with the aim of developing space exploration technology together. Currently, there are at least ten things that are considered to be the “vehicles” for the development of space exploration, some of which are satellite launch technology, satellite-based communications, deep space exploration, and space tourism. The International Space Station or better known as the ISS is one of the biggest icons of this multinational collaboration where almost all experiments and observations of bioastronautics and space medicine are carried out on the platform. However, the collaborations carried out by these various agencies do not stop at anthropocentric fields, but also in more fundamental fields such as cosmology and astrophysics. One of the major collaborative projects in the field of astrophysics is the Event Horizon Telescope project where several large radio telescopes in various parts of the world form an array of telescopes with an effective size of the earth so that they can have a high enough resolution to see black hole-like objects at long distances. From the things that have been mentioned above, it can be easily concluded that space exploration has contributed so much progress, especially in the advancement of science.</p> <p>To realize the collaboration and exploration that has been carried out from time to time, as previously mentioned, of course, requires no small amount of money, it can even be considered very large.</p> <blockquote>Therefore we can ask, is space exploration necessary and profitable? How do we assess space exploration from an economic point of view?</blockquote> <p>These questions basically never have a definite answer since the economic aspect of everything is very dependent on human needs which, of course, continue to change with changing times. History says that the problem of the economic value of space exploration always brings up two opposing groups with contradictory arguments, for example, in the era of the cold war space race, 47% of people in the United States stated that government money allocated for the development of space technology should be used for other needs on earth that is more related to human life. This contradiction may be caused by the lack of access to space awareness in most people so that space seems to be only a beautiful stage on earth which is enough to be a view and basic human needs are more important to be met first. On the other hand, of course, we cannot blame this conservative view because basically the urgency of exploring the universe is far below the primary needs of humans and humans can live a good life without space knowledge. However, it does not mean that space exploration is a disadvantage and has no economic value at all.</p> <p>In fact, so much of the technology that later became the foundation of human life came from advanced space exploration technology, whether it was direct ones such as transportation and telecommunications or spin-offs such as navigation and meteorology. Space exploration has proven to be an accelerated development of these technologies because space is a very hostile area to explore. This big challenge is what triggers the acceleration of technology development, which at this time may still be too advanced to be able to interact with human life directly, but it may become an inseparable part of human life in the future. An example is the development of weather measurement driven by advances in satellite technology. Satellite technology not only offers measurement locations around the atmosphere that was previously impossible on the earth’s surface but also sensor technology with high accuracy. Satellite technology for weather is then used in various things such as weather prediction for the general public to transportation. The facts above show that there are potentials for great economic value in the development of space exploration technology. Therefore, the budgeting of state and corporate money for space exploration can be considered a long-term investment whose value will grow very large in the future.</p> <p>Based on the explanation above, it is reasonable that almost all countries in the world provide a budget for space technology research in general, although only a small part of these countries focus on space exploration. The budget for space research is considered one of the supporting factors for the progress of a country in terms of science, technology and even state defence. It is not seldom that a country, especially developed countries, set aside very large funds for a space exploration project, for example, the James Webb space telescope project which spent at least nine billion US dollars. This large budget makes the government’s role to be central in policy making and capitalizing on space exploration projects. This has given rise to a polemic in the development of space exploration technology because if space exploration capital can only be carried out by the state, then a science-literate government is needed to support programs related to this matter. This is one of the factors that makes the gap in technological capacity between developed and developing countries quite large. Based on these facts, Indonesia, as one of the countries that are not yet advanced enough in space technology, needs to accelerate the development of technology, especially in the current era of space race 2.0 where the race to explore space is no longer dominated by developed countries but also companies. private companies that have large enough funds to fund their own space exploration.</p> <p>Of course, the development of science and technology is a great challenge for the Indonesians, not only because the people are still not sufficiently scientifically literate, but also many other aspects that are prioritized to be funded by the state such as transportation and food which are public’s basic needs. Moreover, paying special attention to space technology puts Indonesia in a fairly difficult position to compete with other groups in this second space race. Therefore, it is necessary to realize that there is still a long way to go to be able to adopt and apply the same space technology as developed countries and the public cannot fully rely on government funds for all space research projects.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the difficulty of this position should not reduce people’s optimism, especially in the Indonesian science community to continue to develop our space science and technology since there are many other ways to contribute to this. For example, by developing space science and technology that is unique to Indonesia, such as in the field of hilal observation methods, astronomical tourism through local culture, and many more. These fields, indeed, do not look as grand as the multi-billion James Webb telescope project, but we need to realize that these fields also have considerable potential economic value. Moreover, the development of fields such as economic tourism can be carried out by the community independently so that there is no need to rely on government funds to manage it.</p> <p>In conclusion, based on the explanation above, we know that space exploration has enormous potential economic value, but this value has not been felt by developing countries due to the large gap in science and technology between developed countries and other groups in general. Therefore, this potential needs to be realized, not only by stakeholders, namely the government but also by society in general and the scientific community in particular. With this awareness, it is hoped that we as members of the scientific community will be more motivated to explore these potentials and find various ways to contribute to the development of human space science and technology.</p> <p>Here are some further readings you can access</p> <p>1. history.com Editor, 2010, “<em>The Space Race”</em>, <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/space-race" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/space-race</a>,</p> <p>2.
