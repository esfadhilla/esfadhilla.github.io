He reported this quite baffling phenomenon to the community of the British Association in his 1844 “Report on Waves” where he named the phenomenon the “great wave of translation”. Unbeknownst to him, his reported phenomenon became an important characteristic which can be found in lots of dynamic systems in modern days.</em></p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Vfx94nJNyFDzI7dc"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@enginakyurt?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">engin akyurt</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure> <p>In the report, he described the phenomenon as follows: “… I was observing the motion of a boat which was rapidly drawn along a narrow channel by a pair of horses, when the boat suddenly stopped — not so the mass of water in the channel which it had put in motion; it accumulated round the prow of the vessel in a state of violent agitation, then suddenly leaving it behind, rolled forward with great velocity, assuming the form of a large solitary elevation, a rounded, smooth and well-defined heap of water, which continued its course along the channel apparently without change of form or diminution of speed…”</p> <p>From Russell’s report shown above, there are some key traits of the peculiar wave, namely, it is a solitary lump of water body with a consistent shape, it moves with a constant speed along the channel and, lastly, it does not disperse to the main water body without any disturbance. With these traits, the wave observed by him seemed to violate the law of nature since, at the time, the wave known to the scientists will disperse immediately after they formed. Certainly, this observation triggered a great challenge among the community to explain such a peculiar waveform.</p> <p>It took more than fifty years for scientists to finally close the mysteries surrounding Russell’s wave. The challenge was completed by Korteweig and de Vries by taking the small amplitude limit of irrotational two-dimensional motion of incompressible inviscid fluid, resulting in a non-linear hyperbolic differential equation (wave equation) known as, the celebrated, Korteweig-de Vries equation (KdV equation) which reported in their paper published in 1895 where they showed that the stationary solution of this equation turned out to exactly match the waveform observed and simulated in the lab by Russell, as demonstrated in the following figure. This equation is considered to be among the first non-linear models of physical systems known to the community.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0x4S0lAEV1GzuZk4mWGUKA.gif"><figcaption>A solitary wave solution to the K-dV equation which resembles Russell’s canal wave</figcaption></figure> <p>Starting from just this small observation of the water in a canal, the study of non-linear wave phenomena become central in modern-day technologies. We call this type of wave the soliton which comes from the “solitary” and “non-dispersive” properties, making them resemble the behaviours of a particle. As such, soliton theory has been applied to describe lots of dynamic system, ranging from the classical systems such as flow of plasma and wave in strings to the more complex systems such as nucleons and standard model.</p> <p>An example of modern application in soliton theory is the study of Skyrmion which is actually a soliton emerging from a sphere-like objects. The Skyrmion can be found in a wide range of systems as well, such as two-dimensional magnetic material and higher dimensional <em>p-</em>branes (a generalization of membrane in higher dimensional space). One unique property possessed by Skyrmions is that the stability of such soliton came from a conserved charge related to the topology of Skyrmion field (the function that maps the space where Skyrmion lives to the sphere-like object representing the Skyrmion), hence it belongs to the special type of solitons known as topological solitons. The Skyrmion plays central role in the technology of spintronic-based storage device where we can manipulate the states with far less power than the electronic-based device, resulting in a more energy-efficient storage device.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*Gy_qzmiv9wKxp3kVUUBlkQ.gif"><figcaption>A Skyrmion in two-dimensional magnetic material.</figcaption></figure> <p>It is exceptional that such a simple phenomenon of peculiar wave has lead us to a whole different advance technologies we have nowadays. However, there are actually many more soliton phenomena that has been observed and exploited by humankind which have not been mentioned in this article, not to mention another potential technologies which have not discovered yet. As a conclusion, there are still a lot of prospects of discovery within the soliton theory and technology in general.</p> <p>If you want to know more, here are some further readings you can access</p> <ol> <li>P.
